We have collected 4449 Android apps that leak privacy data through inter-component communication. 
We call this dataset as “”.

To better mitigate privacy leaks in Android apps, we are happy to release the entire detected apps (IccRE) to the research community.
However, to avoid this dataset from being misused, we feel the need to have some sort of authentication in place to verify user identity or require necessary justification, instead of making the dataset completely public.
If you are interested in this dataset, please send us an email (through your official email address) with your necessary credentials such as name, affiliation and so on.
Note that currently IccRE is hosted at ,so please send us a github account along with your request email so that we can grant you permission to download this dataset.

Please send your request emails to "" with " Samples Request" in the subject.
